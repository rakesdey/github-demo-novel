Environment Pollution Paragraph in 200 Words

Environmental pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances into the natural environment, 
resulting in adverse effects on living organisms and the planet’s balance. 
It primarily occurs in four major forms: air, water, soil, and noise pollution.
Air pollution is caused by vehicle emissions, burning of fossil fuels,
and industrial smoke, 
leading to respiratory diseases, global warming, 
and depletion of the ozone layer. Water pollution 
results from dumping industrial waste, plastic, and sewage into 
rivers, lakes, and oceans, which harms aquatic life and contaminates drinking water. 
Soil pollution comes from the excessive use of pesticides, chemicals, and non-biodegradable waste, reducing soil fertility
and affecting food quality. Noise pollution, caused by traffic, machinery, and urbanization, creates stress and hearing issues for
humans and disturbs wildlife. Moreover, unchecked pollution contributes heavily to climate change, rising sea levels, 
and extreme weather patterns.
